Setting up the environment

GLUT
*what is glut?*
As the official GLUT is not updated, I choose the freeglut implementation (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/).
Freeglut is distributed as sources so you can build yourself. Or if you are lazy as I am, you can get a package precompiled for MSVC here: http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/
Installation is straightforward: unzip it to a folder of your choice.
